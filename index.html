                <p1>
                  Remember this is the first impression for employers! Make it easy for them to see how awesome you are! <br>
                  Employers care about the quality of your resumes. We know this because we've had employers reject students based on some grammatical errors that just takes a few more minutes to fit. <br>
                  Important things to remember... <br>
                  Did you include a project description that has enough detail <br>
                  Do your projects have detailed Read Me notes <br>
                  Are there grammatical errors in your resume <br>
                  Did you take the time to write your summary so that it makes you stand out? <br>
                  <br>
                  Resumes need to be consistently updated with all your skills, experience, and projects. <br>
                  Put new projects first <br>
                  List what technologies you used for each project <br>
                  Include an explanation of what your app does <br>
                  GitHub account and all projects need to be hyperlinked on the resume <br>
                  Make sure GitHub accounts are employer ready! <br>
                  If you have projects in progress/not live still put it on your resume, you can say it‚Äôs in progress and not link it to your GitHub account if you don‚Äôt feel the code is ready to show.
                  Keep your resume hyperlink the same so we‚Äôre always sending your updated resume to employer
                  <br>

                <p1>
                  For the apps that you want to showcase on GitHub, add a Readme.md that includes video/gif/images by adding ![Title](videoname.jpg) in the .md file. Employers care a lot if you‚Äôve successfully put something on the
                  App Store, so while
                  you‚Äôre
                  working on that, get it on Testflight! <br>

            https://www.resume.com/lighthouselabs">Example Here</a> <br>
                  Add a bullet about deploying your app on the app store to the project description. Employers like that. <br>

                Search Tips:
                Don‚Äôt just look up ‚ÄúJunior iOS developer or Junior Web Developer‚Äù, companies have different ways of titling their positions (ie. Software Engineer, Software Developer, Web Developer, Web Programmer, etc.)
                Try looking up languages that you‚Äôre familiar with instead (ie. JavaScript, Ruby, Swift, PHP, Python) , and filter via experience level or try including the words ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù or ‚Äújunior‚Äù to filter the results further

          Important Tips
        </h3>
        <p1>
          <ul>
            <li>During interviews, it is advisable to speak to your GitHub profile. While GitHub is not the end all be all of ways to measure candidates, some employers use it as a metric to determine how active and how much experience a candidate
              has.</li>
            <li>If you are coding outside of github you should bring it onto your github profile!</li>
            <li>Have clean and thorough Readmes (see below)</li>
            <li>It is recommended to add your final project on your pinned repo list. Considering forking, if it‚Äôs not your repo. Make sure final projects have a complete readme.</li>
            <li>Star newer and your best repos so that they are coming up on the first page; consider getting rid of your older repositories that don‚Äôt add breadth or depth to showcase your skills</li>
            <li>According to Rohan at Highline Beta ‚ÄúOne big tip I give Jr. Devs is to start contributing heavily to Open Source projects. The easiest way to start is to start doing Pull Requests for grammar, move to documentation, and then start
              doing
              bug fixes. At the very least it shows me that they are willing to put in work while also learning new skills, and it's quick hacks to doing some real implementation work outside of a team.‚Äù </li>

                <li>Pro Tip: Your last question in an interview should always be about next steps. If you do not hear by when they let you know they will get back to you, you can also send a follow-up email the day after you expected to hear.

                Hi Lauren,</br></br>
                I hope this note finds you well. Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me, and those additional tips on how to approach my final project. I took some time to dig deeper into X, and learned more about Y as well.
                You mentioned that you‚Äôd be making a decision for the ‚Äúposition title‚Äù role by the end of last week. Do you have any updates on the role? I‚Äôm still very interested in joining ‚ÄúCompany Name‚Äù.
                </br></br>
                Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything I can provide to assist you in your decision-making process.
                </br>Thank you,
                </br>Tom

          Networking tips at Job Fairs:</br>
          <ul>
            <li>DON‚ÄôT: Ask questions like ‚Äúwhat do you do?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat are you hiring for?‚Äù because this information is available to you (online or at the booth)</li>
            <li>DO: Ask impactful questions about the role, the team, and the best parts about working at the company</li>
            <li>DO: Identify key employers you want to connect with and do deeper research about them beforehand (their values, recent news stories, or fun/unique things about working with
              their team)</li>
            <li>DO: Think about ways that you can make a positive and lasting impression. Employers talk to lots of people at these events so make sure you‚Äôre asking questions that are thoughtful and engaging.</li>
            <li>DON‚ÄôT: Put the follow-up on them - Ask how you can follow-up!</li>
